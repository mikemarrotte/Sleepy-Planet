# Sleepy Planet - Obsidian Publishing System

Welcome to the Sleepy Planet knowledge base! This site is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a fast static site generator that transforms Obsidian notes into a beautiful, searchable website.

## About This System

This publishing system provides:
- 🆓 **Free alternative** to Obsidian Publish
- 🔗 **Wiki-style linking** between notes
- 📊 **Interactive graph view** of connections
- 🔍 **Full-text search** capabilities  
- 📱 **Mobile-responsive** design
- 🚀 **Automated publishing** via GitHub Actions

## How It Works

1. **Write** - Create notes in Obsidian with standard markdown
2. **Sync** - Changes automatically sync to GitHub
3. **Build** - GitHub Actions builds the static site
4. **Publish** - Site deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

## Getting Started

Browse the notes using the sidebar, search for topics, or explore the graph view to discover connections between ideas.
